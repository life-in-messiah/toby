# toby
Open source child theme starting point to the premium Enfold theme on Wordpress.  By no means feature-complete for a good child theme, this simply removes some extraneous things that I found less than useful across my Enfold website projects.

### Usage
Copy/paste the 'toby' folder into the `wp-content/wp-themes` folder and then activate the Toby theme in your Wordpress admin panel.  That is all.
